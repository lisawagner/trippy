# Trippy

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Fetching Data + useEffect

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Why useEffect`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Fetching Data with useEffect`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `The Dependency Array`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `Dependencies + useCallback`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
